# Saved Polygon Test Data

This directory contains polygon data automatically saved from the mission planner UI.

Each time you generate a path in the UI, the polygon configuration is saved here with a timestamp.

Files are named: polygon_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json

Use test_from_saved_data.py to test these saved polygons.
